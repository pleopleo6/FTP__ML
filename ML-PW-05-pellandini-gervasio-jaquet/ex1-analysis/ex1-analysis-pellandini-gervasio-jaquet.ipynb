    "The bank UBS is offering the possibility to invest money in investment funds. A fund is composed of financial values such as stocks or bonds. For example, a fund composed mostly of stocks has more return potential but is more risky in case of stock market recession. There are thousands of funds available, see https://fundgate.ubs.com/. The probability to invest or not in a fund is conditioned by the profile of the fund and of the client. For example, a younger client with no child is potentially more interested into funds composed with stocks, showing higher risks but also higher potential returns. A family father will be more inclined to invest into low-risk funds. UBS want to build a system as illustrated on Figure~\\ref{fig:ubs_system}, taking as input a set of values characterizing the fund and the client profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "An investment fund can be characterized by the following elements: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The name of the fund.\n",
    "- The current value of 1 share in the fund, expressed in CHF.\n",
    "- The proportion of stock and bonds composing the fund (2 values in percentage).\n",
    "- A vector of float values with the 5 last yearly returns over years from 2015 to 2019 (5 values expressed in percentage).\n",
    "- A level of risk expressed with A, B, C, D, E with A representing the highest risk and E representing the lowest risk level.\n",
    "- A sectorial information such as technology, pharmaceutical, financial. There are 24 different sectors available in UBS funds.\n",
    "-  As the set of funds are worldwide, the emiting location is also available with the address of the managing entity of the fund, e.g. Market Street 1234, New York, USA.\n",
    "\n",
    "A client profile contains the following information: \n",
    "\n",
    "- First name and last name of the client.\n",
    "- The mother tongue of the client (mostly de, fr, it and en but other languages are present).\n",
    "- The age of the client.\n",
    "- The number of children of the client.\n",
    "- The current wealth of the client that could be used to buy funds, expressed in CHF (total of cash available in the different accounts, not yet invested in funds).\n",
    "- The postal code of the address of the client.\n",
    "- A level of acceptance to risk expressed with A, B, C, D, E with A representing the highest level of acceptance of risk and E representing the lowest acceptance of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each available information in the fund and client profile, explain how you would prepare the data: encoding, normalization, outlier treatment, etc.\n",
    "2. How could you collect targets (output of the system) to train the system? How would you prepare the different sets?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be as comprehensive as possible.**  Don't limit your explanation to the \"how\" but also the \"why\"."
